# Hobby-Amp

## Description
- I always have a hard time deciding on the restaurant/cafe I'll be dining at whenever I go out. 
- Hobby Amp is a simple project that uses the TripAdvisor API and randomly selects a cafe/restaurant without me deliberating :smile: 
- Created this to help me improve my API development skills and also eliminate the terrible headaches 😌

## Design
Here's the initial design I created on Figma:
